#GOOGLE HOMEPAGE CLONE

This project was inspired by my coding boot camp teacher Lachland Heywood. This is my first solo project and the goal of it is to learn more about HTML and CSS, especially positioning. The goal was to make this a picture perfect clone of the Google homepage.

This first project took 4 hours to complete it was very fun and i learned a lot about CSS data types and positioning. I also got a better understanding of sizing child divs within parent div containers. I also learned about Github pages to host this project on. Very exciting!
